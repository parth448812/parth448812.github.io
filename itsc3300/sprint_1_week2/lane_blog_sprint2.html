        <h3>Schedule Management</h3>     
        <ul class="order menu">
            <p>Project schedule management is incredibly important for success of a project. It makes sure that the project is done on time and follows the budget with the least amount
                of disruptions. This blog will explain how to implement this into your own work and explain <b>critical path analysis</b>. I will explain topics such as project timelines, enhancing 
                overall resource allocation and reducing deadline risks (going over estimated time). 
            </p>
            <h4>Why should you be prioritizing project schedule management?</h4>
            <li>Project schedule management is pretty much necessary for anybody looking to make a name for themselves in the real world. If you want to manage a project but do not
                possess the skills to manage the schedule, you are going to go way over the timeline of what customers want in you. 
            </li>
            <li>By being a better schedule manager, you and your developers will make more money for the time you are spending. By using proper schedule management skills you are going
                to be able to cut down on wasted effort and man hours on tasks that would otherwise take much longer.
            </li>
            <li>By learning how to use the critical-path-analysis method, you will be able to allot timelines for each task necessary to complete the project. This means you will be able
                to more accurately inform customers and developers of how long a certain part of the project should take, and thus also be able to allot more efficient resources towards said tasks.
                This can save a lot of heartache and money in the long run. 
            </li>
            <li>A good project manager always prioritizes customer satisfaction, and without proper schedule management, none of your customers will be happy. By providing a consistent and reliable
                schedule to customers you will get better reviews and more leads on projects to manage, thus making you more money. 
            </li>

        <h3>What is the Critical Path Analysis Method?</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <p>The critical path method is a powerful tool in any project manager's arsenal. The critical path represents the longest sequence of events which can point out just how 
                long is expected for the project to be completed. By doing this, project managers can find out what specific events/activities are going to take the longest, thus being
                able to watch these specific activities to make sure they don't take longer than expected. This can also help identify what events/activities are not going to take very long. 
                This can make a sort of priority list of tasks, some being higher priority and some being lower.
            </p>
            <p>A big part of the benefits of the critical path analysis method is determining <b>timelines</b> of specific events. The way this is done is by outlining the specific duties that
            need to be done and assigning a <i>minimum</i> and <i>maximum</i> time expected to complete these activities. By doing this, it is easy to give a roundabout answer to how long a project
        might take, by adding the minimums and maximums to give a "longest" or "shortest" timeframe of the project completion. </p>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are the benefits of using Critical Path Analysis</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <p>Benefits of using the CPA method is making sure the project doesn't go over the timeline. When you start a project and get the requirements outlines, most customers/stakeholders 
                want to know how long the project is going to take before they get a return on investment. By using the critical analysis method, you can provide these people with an answer, even
                if the answer is not necessarily pinpoint accurate. For instance, a project that has a minimum timeline of 5 months and a maximum timeline of 12 months, you can tell customers that
                they can expect the project to take anywhere from 5 months to a year. 
            </p>

        <h3>Resource Allocation</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <p>Resource allocation is incredibly important when it comes to project management. Resource allocation involves moving the budget around to make the project manageable. This
                can mean that you need to move more workers towards a higher priority task or maybe that you need to dedicate more time to a certain task than previously thought. <b>Why 
                    do I need to do this though?</b> The answer is pretty simple. <i>Saving money is making money.</i> If you are able to allocate resources in a more efficient manner than
                    was previously arranged, you are in essence pocketing the extra money that you saved in your budget.</p>
            <h4>Examples of how allocate resources more efficiently</h4>
            <li>If there are more workers on a low priority task than is necessary compared to a high priority task, use critical-path-analysis to evaluate the man hours needed to complete
                each task and reevaluate how you have developers spread out. If the lower task only needs 2 people but has 4 on it, move the 2 extras to a higher priority task to speed up completion
                of the higher priority task.
            </li>
            <li>If there is more time being put into a certain task than previously expected move a couple developers in and out of said task. Sometimes all that is needed to speed up a task is to 
                get a fresh set of eyes on the task. Some developers may get tunnel vision on what they believe the solution is, and thus they will not think outside of the box like some fresh eyes may. 
            </li>
            <li>Conduct critical-path-analysis multiple times throughout the project development. Some events may take longer/shorter than expected, so by doing critical-path-analysis
                throughout the entirety of the project development process, you can update the projected timeline of the project and update the stakeholders on the timeline. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <p>Critical Path Analysis is incredibly important for every project manager to be able to do. Whether it be a small project or a big project, a timeline of the project is 
                always invaluable to both the developing team and the customers/stakeholders. By using critical-path-analysis, you can essentially get a look in to the future and see
                what the project is going to entail in terms of time investment. By combining critical path analysis with proper resource allocation, a project manager can save/make a lot
                more money than they would without these skills.
