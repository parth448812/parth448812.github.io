    <h2>Tips on Communication: Schedule Management and Delays</h2>

            <li>Scheduling is a big part of any project team.  However, projects are rarely straightforward, and as project scope and requirements evolve, scheduling can become complicated.  Teams will use Gantt charts and other tools to try and ensure that tasks are planned out in advance, but it’s important to know who is going to be working on what.  This blog hopes to cover some of the issues that may arise in project management scheduling, and how team communication can help mitigate these issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Presenting the Issues</h3>

        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>During the process of scheduling, conflicts may arise.  Some of these include: vague or unclear project goals, scope creep (as talked about in a previous blog), and poor allocation of project resources.  While on the surface these may not seem like issues related to scheduling, they should absolutely be considered when scheduling for a project team.</li>
            <li>A project that contains unclear project goals is bound to fail due to issues tied all the way back to project planning.  Projects suffering from this typically have confusion as to what their end goal is, and have trouble communicating with project stakeholders, which leads to a collapse in the middle of the project.</li>
            <li>A project that contains scope creep, as mentioned in a previous blog, may have had a clear goal at the beginning of the project but that goal gets blurrier and blurrier as more ideas are thrown at it.  Eventually the project’s goals are too broad for the budget/time and it leads to a project with multiple unfinished features.</li>
            <li>A project that contains poor resource allocation usually suffers from poor budget management and can sometimes be the victim of the other two mentioned issues.  Projects in this group tend to have too many people working on one small task while having not enough people and resources spent on another more intensive task.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Project Scheduling Tips to the Rescue</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>So how can you, as a project manager, address these issues through scheduling?  After all, even though the execution phase is the most resource intensive phase, the planning phase is even more important.  The importance lies in creating a good foundation for the project’s future, and part of this foundation are good scheduling habits.</li>
        </ul>

            <figcaption>[3]: Work Breakdown Structure</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>A very important document in the scheduling phase is the work breakdown structure.  This document shows each phase of development with branches corresponding to the various aspects of that phase.  To create a WBS, you have to analyze your project’s scope, figure out the activities needed to finish the project and what resources should be allocated to those activities, as well as determine the activity length (in real time) and what activities depend on what other activities.  It is a lot of work to create a WBS, but it is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>One important thing to remember when creating the activities is to figure out what their dependencies are.  There are four types of dependencies: finish to start (B must start only after A finishes), start to start (B can only start when A starts), finish to finish (B can only finish when A finishes), and start to finish (B can only finish once A has started).  Determining what dependencies each of your project’s activities has is a key step in planning out your project’s schedule and even who should be assigned to each activity.</li>
            <li>In addition to plotting out the WBS, it's important to delegate the right amount of team members to each activity.  Tools like Trello are great in that they give an easy visualization of upcoming activities and show who is working on what.  Staying on top of who is doing what also helps with team organization and is highly beneficial for the project's success.  It also helps prevent issues that could lead to poor allocation of project resources.</li>

        <ul class="order">
            <li>Addressing scope creep is something covered in a previous blog, but scope creep in the context of schedule management is handled by understanding when your project has too many activities for your team and/or budget to handle.  While scope creep isn’t inherently an effect of a poor schedule, it’s important to try and limit activities to a certain point so that the risk of scope creep is reduced.</li>
            <li>Finally, as a project manager, you should periodically review your project schedule to ensure that the schedule remains effective and efficient.  Review your planned and actual dates, durations, resource quantities, and performance measurement.  Keeping your project members up to date on the current status of the project schedule is a good way to ensure that your team isn’t left in the dark, and will help ensure your project is on the right track when it comes to satisfying your stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>As project managers, it is our responsibility to maintain an orderly workflow, and the planning phase (specifically the scheduling phase) is the greatest step that a project manager can take.  If you find yourself facing project delays or schedule issues, always remember what is important: minimizing scope creep, having a transparent schedule, and analyzing schedule activities in the context of resources and team members.</li>
            <li>The more and more you integrate these strategies with your projects, the more and more successful you will find your projects to be.  Remember that no project is perfect and there will be hurdles, but as long as you know how to handle problems (like the ones with scheduling), you will find that it will come to you more naturally.</li>
