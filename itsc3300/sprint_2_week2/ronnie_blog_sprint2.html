        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Imagine the scenario where you are managing a project, and you find yourself in a resource crisis.  The tasks that need to be finished within the next week didn’t have enough resources allocated at the start, but you failed to notice since the project was going well enough a few weeks before.  You thought that since things were going smoothly in tasks A-D that E-G would follow suit, but now you realize that you mismanaged your resources–a big mistake to make early on.</li>        
            <li>In this blog, I’ll go over some helpful tools and techniques to assist in the resource management department of a project management position.  Hopefully these pointers will help you in your current or future project management positions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Meet the Resources</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Before we get into the various techniques, let’s run down the various kinds of resources you can encounter in the project management field:</li>
            <li>1. Time: Time is money, as the saying goes.  Time is probably the most crucial resource to your project team, as I’ve covered before it can be the life and death of a project.  Not enough time either means an unfinished product or a project that has to be scrapped ahead of time.</li>
            <li>2. Materials: This pertains to the physical resource requirements a project would need.  This may not apply to all projects, especially in the IT field, but projects that need physical materials to turn into a final product will require these to be measured as resources.</li>
            <li>3. Human Resources: This is the amount of people you will need to help build the project from the beginning to the end.  Keep in mind that the more workers you have on the project, the more it will affect your financial resources.  The more people you add to the project, the more complex it will become as well.</li>
            <li>4. Equipment: Resources that fall into this category include the need for things like servers, computer networks, machinery, and even warehouses if needed.  It’s important that equipment be reserved for the project only when it is needed in order to stay out of the way of other projects while also cutting down on operation price.</li>
            <li>5. Financial Resources: This is probably the most straightforward resource.  The amount of money that will be spent in each phase of the project is important to document as accurately as possible beforehand.  We’ve already covered cost management to aid with this in a previous blog post, so be sure to check that out if you haven’t.</li>
            <li>6. Data: Finally, data is the space that the project will have to store in order to operate.  This mainly pertains to the space it will require in a company’s servers.  It also includes how intensive it is on the company’s bandwidth.  Remember that even if the project isn’t inherently an IT project, most will have some sort of webpage that links from the main company website, which will be factored in here.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Techniques</h3>

        <ul class="order">
            <li>With these constraints, it’s best to go over some techniques that can aid in managing your project resources to avoid hassle when dealing with the various issues that may arise when going in unprepared.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Project Scope and Forecasting</strong> is something that has already been covered in a previous blog, but as it pertains to resource management, it’s important that you are able to identify each unique task and understand what it is doing for the project.  It may not seem directly important to resource management, but even this basic identification of scope could help point out flaws in resource allocation before they become a problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Path and Float</strong> is a very important property of each project task that is crucial to understanding resource management.  The float of a task is how long that task can be delayed before it starts affecting the project’s completion.  Float comes in two types: free float and total float.  Free float is how long a task can be delayed before affecting the next task, and total float is how long a task can be completed before affecting the entire project’s completion time.</li>
            <li>The critical path is then constructed from all the tasks that have zero float, and must be completed as soon as possible for the project to be finished on time.  Anything with positive float is not on the critical path.</li>
            <li><strong>Spotting Resource Utilization</strong> is something that can be used to determine if something is being wasted and where it is being wasted.  There are many tools out there that can help identify resource utilization and notify of any problems that are detected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Tools</h3>

        <ul class="order">
            <li>Obviously, since resource management is highly important to any project, there is lots of software that specializes in resource management.  One such example is ProjectManager’s Resource Planning Software.  The main draws of it include its cost and time tracking, dynamic scheduling, and integration with other business apps like Office 365 and Jira.</li>
            <li>Another useful tool is Monday.com’s resource management template.  While it may not be super advanced, it is a good starting point for smaller projects, and can come in handy when determining when people will be available/done with their tasks.  It also allows users to export the workflow right into Excel.</li>
            <li>Float is a widely-used tool that helps cover all of the techniques listed beforehand.  It has tools to forecast, calculate float, and calculate parts of resource utilization like billing.  You can also log timesheets and export your time data easily.  It also lets you view time tracking and get a good overview of how many hours are being put into each task.</li>
            <li>Hopefully these tips will help you as a project manager understand and combat any future resource management issues that may arise.  As a project manager, the resources you manage are the tools you use to create your final product, so you want to ensure that each tool is being used in the right areas and in the most efficient manner.</li>
