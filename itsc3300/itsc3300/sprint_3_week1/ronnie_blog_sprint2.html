        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Communicating with your team as a project manager is a skill that takes time to master, but rewards those who do it effectively.  In addition, it’s a skill that can make or break a project, and when you look back on successes or failures it’s usually one of the first things that’s noticed.  In this guide I’ll go over some project communication techniques and when to use them.  Hopefully these techniques will help you in your project management position, and bring good utility to your projects.</li>        
        </ul>
        <h3>Projects Across Culture</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>In today’s work environment, it’s not uncommon to find yourself working with colleagues across various countries.  With the normalization of online work, it’s becoming easier to find yourself in a group of people that hold different cultures and languages than you.</li>
            <br>
            <h4>Cross Cultural Communication</h4>
            <li>The baseline for any good project communication is respect, and it’s no different here.  You’ll find that communicating with various people on your project becomes much easier when you understand that everyone is equal regardless of cultural background.  This is most likely already in your mind, but it’s good to point it out.</li>
            <li>Moving on, it’s important that you respect time zones when dealing with colleagues from across the globe.  Make sure that meetings work with your cross-country peers, and if it can’t work live, try to set up recordings that they can watch when they are available.  It may not be perfect, but it’s better than leaving them without anything from a meeting.</li>
            <li>Another way of ensuring that communication is two-way is by encouraging your peers to recap what you went over.  This helps you understand if there is any confusion, and not just from a language barrier.  This honestly applies not only in a cross-culture situation but can be used even in in-person meetings with people speaking the same language.  It’s always good to know people are on the same page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Making Virtual Collaboration Easy</h3>

        <ul class="order">
            <li>When meeting virtually, there are some differences that separate virtual meetings from in-person meetings.  Here are some tips to help facilitate online meetings better from a project manager perspective.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1. Establish a concrete universal meeting channel</strong> to ensure that everyone is on the same page as to where to meet.  Using multiple different meeting mediums could cause confusion as people may think that a meeting is, perhaps, on Zoom rather than on Slack.  Declaring a medium early on and requiring it to be the standard for all future meetings keeps this issue from arising, and it also helps with documenting meetings for reference later.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Scheduling Meetings</strong> ahead of time is another good preemptive task to ensure that everyone is alerted to a meeting.  If you don’t schedule meeting times beforehand, then you may forget to start the meeting on that day, or some coworkers may miss it because it was created at the last second and didn’t notify them quickly enough.  Scheduling meetings (like in Zoom) is a good way to handle these problems while also keeping your team on track in terms of the project’s velocity.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Utilize Icebreakers</strong> to help break in new teams.  You could have a dedicated meeting day to simply help your team get to know each other for this.  Icebreakers are activities that let team members introduce themselves (what they like to do, where they’re from, etc.), and are proven to help teams increase their collaboration and break the initial “ice” when meeting new people.  You don’t want your team to still have “ice” multiple weeks into the project, as it could lead to blockages and sometimes even hostility.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When Things Go Wrong...</h3>

        <ul class="order">
            <li>Obviously as a project manager you would hope that nothing goes wrong with your project.  Unfortunately it’s rare to be 100 percent successful on all your projects and at some point you’ll have one go south.  In these situations once you know the project has to end it’s important to have a crisis communication plan.</li>
            <li>A crisis communication plan consists of the people you want to announce the bad news and how you want to present it.  You want to make sure that the shareholders know that something went wrong, and present what went wrong in a clear manner to ensure full transparency.  A vague explanation could hurt your company’s reputation, but being clear with your communication can help prevent this from happening and is the best possible outcome.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>Just like any other part of project management, it’s important to understand the tools you have at your disposal as a project manager.  Your communication tools and techniques are among those tools, and can turn almost any group of people into a solid project team that produces a product that everyone can be proud of.  Communication is something that pays off very quickly.  Hopefully this guide has helped you in your project communication skills.</li>
