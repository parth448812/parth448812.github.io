            <li>Project management deals with the process of turning an idea into a fully functioning product.  For developers, this process fulfills their needs to apply their knowledge in a real world situation.  For project managers, this applies too.  One of the key aspects of project management is appeasing the needs of stakeholders while also ensuring that the higher-ups are satisfied.  This is done through a long project management process that takes place over weeks to years.  In this blog I’d like to highlight an aspect that appeals to the higher-ups of a company: cost estimation.</li>

        <h3>The Inputs of Cost Estimation</h3>

            <li>Cost estimation is a process in the project management field that takes into account all the resources needed for the project and generates various estimates that are used to gauge what ideas the project team can realistically afford to pursue.  The costs used as inputs are direct costs, which are costs directly related to the project itself, and indirect costs, which are costs related to the functioning of the business or organization (i.e. utility costs).</li>
            <li>A good practice is to identify costs beyond direct and indirect.  Identifying things such as fixed costs, which are costs that are constant such as setup costs and rental costs, variable costs, which are costs that can rise or fall depending on some variable, such as wages paid to workers and electricity costs, and sunk costs, which are unrecoverable costs that are best left behind such as marketing and research (assuming that you did those before this step).</li>
            <li>After identifying the costs, it’s time to develop estimates which will help define a project budget that will be followed for the rest of the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Estimation Tips</h3>

        <ul class="order">
            <li>With multiple different cost types to have to consider, it can be a bit difficult to actually come up with a good estimation of your project’s budget.  Not to worry, however, as there are some good cost estimation tips out there that can help you create a good estimate that can lay the foundation for a project budget.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Analogous Estimation</strong> is a fairly simple solution to a complex problem: use the advice of experts that excel in estimating for a project similar to yours.  Alternatively analogous estimation can include using your own company’s historical data to help gauge your future costs based on what your costs are.  In short, analogous estimation collects data for variables relevant to the project, identifies similarities between the old project and the new project, takes into account what the stakeholders want to emphasize, and calculates the estimate for the project by prioritizing these stakeholder needs.</li>
            <li>Analogous estimation is at its strongest when your project team has little information about your project, when the project’s outline is not well defined (in its early stages), and when a rough estimate will suffice.  However, this strategy does require the organization to have had projects to use as historical data, or have an expert on estimation on hand.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Bottom-Up Estimation</strong> is another estimation technique that focuses on starting with the small things.  In this case, you generate estimates for specific tasks, then tally them all up to get a total estimate for the project.  Where analogous estimation needs historical context to create an estimate, bottom-up estimation doesn’t need this.  This type of estimation also excels in accuracy compared to analogous estimation, and is more set in stone than a rough estimate.</li>
            <li>Bottom up estimation also reduces project risk by helping to point out any possible errors in estimation at the simplest level.  This way, those errors can be detected before they start to compound at the later stages of estimation.  The main drawback of this type of approach is that every time you add tasks to the project, you have to completely start back at square one in order to get a proper estimate.  This is not helped by the fact that it also takes more time to do a bottom up estimation than most other estimation methods.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Three Point Estimation</strong> is an estimation technique that factors in three separate estimations and generates an average case based on those estimates.  The first case is the best case, where the least amount of time (and money) is spent, then the next case is the worst case, where the most time and money is spent, and finally the average case, which is the amount of time and money most likely spent.</li>
            <li>The formula to create the three point estimation is (best case + 4*likely case + worst case) / 6.  The standard deviation of those estimates is (P-O) / 6.  In order to get the mean optimistic and mean pessimistic times, the formulas are (mean - deviation) and (mean + deviation) respectively.  The process of three point estimation involves asking those who will do the task what will be the best, worst, and most likely cases involving the time taken on those tasks.  This information is then inputted into the formulas.</li>
            <li>The key benefit of this estimation method is the risk management factor of it.  Once you know the pessimistic deviation, you can determine how risky the project actually is, as the more it deviates from the most likely estimate, the more risky the project is.  It also helps mitigate overly pessimistic or optimistic estimates that could lead to the project either going through when it is too risky, or not going through because people thought it would be too risky.  The drawback is similar to that of bottom-up estimation in that it takes time to integrate new tasks into the estimate, and can take up time due to the fact it needs to source data from employees.</li>

        <h3>In Conclusion...</h3>

            <li>Whichever estimation method you use on your project is up to your judgment as a project manager.  Keep in mind that these cost estimates are some of the most important aspects to any project, and can help shape the boundaries of the project.  If a project cannot continue due to poor estimation results, it is likely a sign that the project needs to be reworked or scrapped altogether.  Hopefully these tips can help you and other project managers to make conscious decisions on what type of estimations your project needs.</li>
