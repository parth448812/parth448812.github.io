        <h3>Should My Project Use Agile?</h3>     
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>In the rapidly developing world of project management, Agile is a modern methodology that focuses on being more flexible while sacrificing some predictability that traditional methodologies have.  The choice of methodologies can directly control what the final product looks like, so project managers have to choose wisely.  This blog will cover what makes agile good in some aspects, what makes it bad in some aspects, and how it stacks up against the competition in various scenarios.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How Does Agile Work?</h3>

        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Agile centers around periodical “scrums” where the development team develops a product incrementally after a fixed period of time (usually one week) in a process called a “sprint”.  Scrums are led by scrum masters, who work to ensure that their team understands how agile works on top of minimizing harmful blockers to the team that could cause issues.  In addition to these scrums, the sprints themselves have planning periods and retrospective periods at the beginning and end of the sprint respectively.  Agile also focuses more on the product itself rather than the product’s documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are Agile's Pros?</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>Agile, as mentioned before, is a methodology that allows a development team to “work in the present” rather than following an initial comprehensive plan for how they should go about the project.  Also, as agile focuses on the resultant product more, it is able to produce a more coherent product, and overall is much quicker than traditional methodologies while also guiding itself through feedback both internally and externally.  To elaborate more on that, it allows a product to be adaptable to change much more than with traditional methods.</li>
            <li>Another positive side effect of agile being highly motivated by feedback is its ability to make a project transparent and its fostering of communication between the team members.  Developers can easily see what went right/wrong during a sprint and agile makes it easy to see why those things went right/wrong, allowing the team to communicate and fix these issues in a much cleaner fashion than with other methods.  With the emergence of artificial intelligence projects that handle sensitive information like medical records and banking information, it’s important that projects using these technologies have this level of transparency provided by agile.</li>
            <li>The last main pro I’d like to mention is agile’s ability to generate profits better than the competition.  As mentioned before, agile is built to create a product much faster than other methodologies, and therefore enables the fastest profits for the company.  Another factor leading to greater profits is the avoidance of major project fixes that would cost the company money, especially during the execution phase of development which has historically been the most costly for companies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are Agile's Cons?</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>As stated before, Agile focuses on producing a product over spending time on lengthy documentation.  However, this does pose a problem when it comes to record-keeping, because while a slower and more traditional development process spends more time on documenting meeting times and costs, agile tends to prioritize this less.  This could lead to teams putting off documentation and having to rush to produce records of the project in order to have a valid final release.</li>
            <li>While foregoing the need for a concrete plan at the beginning of the project does allow for project flexibility, it does hurt the project’s predictability.  Predictability is something that investors and stakeholders may look at before fully committing to the project, as they want to know what to expect from the development team.  Agile doesn’t always guarantee that the project will end up how it was initially planned, which could deter investors from the project.</li>
            <li>If a team has historically worked with a traditional style like waterfall, then agile could present a problem of transition.  Going from a rigid-predictive approach like waterfall to a more free-flowing approach like agile can genuinely throw off team members.  Of course these issues will fade with practice, but it is something to consider when first switching to agile, and it is something that will likely happen if you’ve stuck with predictive approaches for a good amount of time.  However overall this shouldn’t be a huge risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example Scenarios</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>1.    Lisa is a project manager for a team that has historically found success with waterfall development.  A new project is proposed that requests a product within 6 weeks.  Looking over the requirements, Lisa thinks that waterfall would be too slow to meet the time constraints, but is concerned with switching methodologies as it would be new to some of the employees.  What should Lisa choose?</li>
            <li>In this situation, agile would likely be the best choice as it could provide a product within those time constraints.  The cause for concern here is the lack of previous worker experience, but this is a small issue compared to the time requirement and lack of ability for waterfall to meet these needs.  It also serves as good practice in case future projects need to adopt agile as well.</li>
            <li>2.    Brian is a project manager for a rookie development team that has had little professional development experience.  A new project is proposed that requests a product within 9 weeks, and emphasizes a need for feedback-fueled development as well as good documentation.  Brian isn’t sure what methodology to use.</li>
            <li>In this scenario, the development team would likely want to use agile because of its powerful usage of feedback to fuel development.  While waterfall development could be implemented with feedback in mind, it would be less effective than with agile.  On the topic of documentation, agile development does fall behind the competition a bit.  However, it can be modified with documentation in mind and just because it isn’t as good with documentation as waterfall doesn’t mean that you can’t produce good documentation with agile.</li>
            <li>3.    Kimberly is a project manager for a seasoned development team that has worked with both waterfall and agile.  A new project is proposed that requests a product within 9 weeks, with emphasis on extensive documentation.  The project should also look good for investors and stakeholders should know what they are investing in.  Kimberly already knows what she should use.</li>
            <li>In this scenario, Kimberly picks waterfall because it is the most trusted method for documenting progress alongside being a predictive process that promises the most to stakeholders and investors.  While issues could arise if the time constraint was lower, the long time constraint here allows waterfall to shine.</li>
        </ul>
