        <h3>Intro</h3>     
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>As a new project manager I wanted to learn about the advantages and benefits of agile as it has been a very popular method of software development. In order to get a better understanding of these benefits a person needs to know what agile is. I decided to read an article by Isaac Sacolick to first get a better understanding of what the agile method is.</li>

        <h3>The Agile Method</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Agile is a method of software development that values adaptability to change and constant communication between product owners, managers, and developers. The start of the Agile method always has a user in order to define customer needs in the product. It is the job of the product owner to be the voice of this “user” in order to create a product vision. These are often short and simple in order to show what is trying to be accomplished. The product owner will work with the development team to create user stories based on the product vision which identifies a challenge or goal and what is needed to be done in order for the solution to be complete. The development team will usually have other roles assigned to members such as a team lead, scrum master, or business analyst to create a structure among the development team. Once the team has understood the goals and defined their agile principles they are ready to pick a process methodology which is usually either a scrum or kanban. A kanban is a process where a team will take a user story which I Was talking about before off of a board and work through them until they can complete them and do it again. Then there is a scrum which compiles the work into one or two week long processes called sprints. The product owner prioritizes those user stories and then teams complete the top stories during the sprint. There are plenty of other elements in the agile process but this blog post isn't about defining the entire agile process and I just wanted to give an overview on what the agile process is.</li>

        <h3>Benefits of Agile</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>
                The agile process has been around since 2001 and since then it has been refined to what it is today and it provides many benefits when developing software. After reading a post by Saurabh Rao about the benefits of agile, I learned a lot about the advantages it can provide for your team and product. The four agile values that provide the framework for the method and allow these advantages are individuals and interactions over processes and tools, Working software over
                comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Satisfied Customers:</u> One of the biggest advantages to agile is that it allows for a lot of communication between the customers and the development team especially the product owners. The product owners are involved in every part of the project. Customers can also make edits throughout the development process. This communication is what creates a great customer experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Superior Product Quality:</u> The agile methods rigorous testing during the development cycle assures a high quality product. This consistent testing makes it easy to detect and fix bugs and issues. Also since the clients are involved in the development process they can request their own edits which helps build them their desired product. Agile allows the product to be constantly improving until it meets the needs of the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Less Risk:</u> There is always a risk of mistakes and failures when developing. When using agile there is a decrease in those risks because of the constant communication between the teams and the client which allows everyone to be aware about what is going on and makes it easier to catch errors and fix them earlier which can save resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Increased Productivity:</u> Development teams who use agile work in either kanbans or scrums. Both of these allow work to be broken down into either week or two week long sprints. This makes it easier to organize the work and adapt to unexpected changes. This breaking up of the project puts deadlines on every step which leads to completing these steps faster and makes it easy to put a timeline on the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u></u>Predictability:</u> Since the project is broken into pieces that all have deadlines it is easy to predict issues that might occur and give an accurate timeline. When each step of the project is layed out it is easy to see the big picture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Increased Collaboration and Morale:</u> Agile gives each team member autonomy in their own tasks and everyone knows what they need to get done. Each person knows their role in the project and communicates with each other in order to get it done. Agile emphasizes communication and team work with daily meetings. This allows team members to build bonds and increase their morale. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Encouraged adaptability:</u> Being able to adapt to changes is incredibly important in development. Agile allows a more flexible development process so unforeseen or predicted issues do not take more time then they need to or cost more money than needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>
                Using Agile as your development method can be incredibly beneficial. Agiles adaptability can save time and money as it allows efficient solutions to problems as they appear. There are a lot of changes and unexpected issues throughout the development process. The client being a part of the process allows them to make changes as they see fit and since agile is so flexible it is easy to be done. The enforced communication between everyone involved in the project keeps everyone on the same page. Agile has proven to be effective as you can see in the results users of the practice love it. I believe it is important for anyone who plans to be on a development team to learn and understand how agile works.
