        <h3>What are the principles of Agile?</h3>     
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Satisfy customers with constant deliveries of usable and valuable software.</li>
            <li>Allow changes to requirements throughout the development process for a competetive advantage.</li>
            <li>Make deliverables once every two weeks to a month at the <strong>latest</strong>.</li>
            <li>Allow <i>developers</i> and <i>buesinessman/owners</i> to cooperate daily to facilitate customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Give developers and business owners <strong>freedom</strong> to complete work with trust that they complete given work.</li>
            <li>Encourage face-to-face conversation to create the most effective work environment for developers.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Working software</i></strong> is the biggest tell of progress.</li>
            <li>Agile is built to sustain development for long periods of time. Due to this, development can and should be able to maintain at a constant pace for as long as needed.</li>
            <li>Constant monitoring and attention to high achievements and well-structured software makes Agile work better.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity's importance</strong> cannot be overstated. It is essential to maintain simple development.</li>
            <li>Excellent structure and adherence to requirements comes from self-organized teams. Allow developers to organize themselves to their strengths instead of micromanaging.</li>
            <li>Hold meetings <strong>regularly</strong> to discuss downfalls and achievements to make development focus on how to become better/faster, not slower/worse.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What do these principles promote?</h3>     
        <ul class="order menu">
            The principles of agile are all designed for a specific reason.
            <li><strong>Satisfy customers with constant deliveries of usable and valuable software.</strong> This principle is designed to ensure that customers are constantly getting
            a fresh installment of how development is going. This is similar to a blog by a game developer to patrons of the software.</li>
            <li><strong>Allow changes to requirements throughout the development process for a competetive advantage.</strong> This principle means that the software should be adaptable
            to social changes and customer needs. This promotes adaptability to requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Make deliverables once every two weeks to a month at the latest.</strong> This reinforces the first principle, meaning that installments of development should be
            regular and timely.</li>
            <li><strong>Allow developers and buesinessman/owners to cooperate daily to facilitate customer satisfaction.</strong> This facilitates developer and customer interaction,
            allowing for better communication between the two teams. This makes sure the end product meets the requirements of customers and actually works to their desire.</li>
            <li><strong>Give developers and business owners freedom to complete work with trust that they complete given work.</strong> This allows developers to be trusted and
            continue work without being interrupted too often by management, which enhances self-efficacy and development speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage face-to-face conversation to create the most effective work environment for developers.</strong> Software developers sometimes lack in communication,
            so this principle helps to reinforce the necessity for constant communication between developers and management to make sure the process is coming along well and nobody
            is falling behind unnecessarily.</li>
            <li><strong>Working software is the biggest tell of progress.</strong> This principle is in place to make sure that the software, at any point in time, is functional.
            This does not mean that the software needs to fit every requirement before deployment, however it makes sure that development is being put towards functional parts of the
            software and isn't breaking the codebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Agile is built to sustain development for long periods of time. Due to this, development can and should be able to maintain at a constant pace for as long as needed.</strong>
            This principle is one of the most important. It is in place to make sure that Agile can sustain development for a long project, as adaptability is one of the biggest points of
            Agile. This makes software last longer and be maintainable in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Constant monitoring and attention to high achievements and well-structured software makes Agile work better.</strong> Allowing developers to bring forth problems
            and achievements lets others see what is happening and either help or gain knowledge from coworkers progress. This can facilitate a stronger team and builds on everybody's strengths.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity's importance cannot be overstated. It is essential to maintain simple development.</strong> Agile is meant to facilitate simple structure and code,
            which makes maintenance and refactoring much easier in the future. This makes adaptability all the better and allows customers to be satisfied much more.</li>
            <li><strong>Excellent structure and adherence to requirements comes from self-organized teams. Allow developers to organize themselves to their strengths instead of micromanaging.</strong>
            This principle is very important to individual developers, as it makes work feel less like work and more like a fun project. It allows team members to structure themselves to their
            strengths and allows the software to grow with themselves. This discourages management from placing someone who is better at front-end development in back-end development.</li>
            <li><strong>Hold meetings regularly to discuss downfalls and achievements to make development focus on how to become better/faster, not slower/worse.</strong> This, like the 
            "face-to-face meetings" principle, reinforces communication between developers and management. It brings forth the best of what people have created and the issues developers are
            running into. This allows the team as a whole to provide solutions to problems in a more efficient manner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why use Agile?</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Agile, being a fundamentally changing system of development, allows the software to be manipulated to fit requirements that may come
            up in the future. This means that a piece of software that was built to serve on function could be changed to serve another function that may become necessary in the
            future. An example could be a video game which uses an anti-cheat to target a specific cheat-software. Being that cheats are always being made to try to get through any
            firewall being made, the game developers made need to create more functionality within their anti-cheat. In this way, Agile can allow for ever-changing development
            towards this.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer satisfaction:</strong> Again, something that video game developers have to tackle is making customers <i>happy</i>. Many different trends and fads
            come and go in the video game industry, developers need to satisfy customers to make money. Agile allows developers to change focus and satisfy customer's needs if a new
            trend comes in. An example could be with Call of Duty integrating Warzone, a battle-royale type game-mode.</li>
            <li><strong>Team chemistry:</strong> Software development requires a good team with aligned goals. In some teams, individuals may be assigned to a role in which they are
            not the most comfortable in. This can create issues with personal interests. In Agile, self-organization is a key part of the process, thus allowing teams to assign members
            to roles they feel strongest in. This allows for better chemistry between members and also better cooperation between development teams and business owners/customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>The 12 principles of agile all revolve around one central idea: <strong>Simplicity and adaptability</strong>. Agile is perfect for teams working on a project that is
            meant to provide use for extended periods of time and fit ever-changing customer needs. Team chemistry, adaptability, simplicity and excellency is held on a pedestal to make
            the best software possible.</li>
        </ul>
