        <h3>Scaling Risk Management for Small Projects</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Risk management is necessary for every project regardless of size. Many teams are smaller in size and though they may have a smaller scale than others, they also need to address the issue of risks, and so there are some ways in which a project manager can scale typical practices down to fit their needs. Unique constraints and necessities are always something that a project manager needs to address, so the sooner you can identify your constraints, the better, and the quicker you will be able to create a security protocol for your project. This blog post will address how to find your constraints specific to your team and project, and the best practices with security to fit those unique needs.</li>

        <h3>Basics of Risk Management</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Risk management is something that is very important to grasp as a project manager. Risk management is the process of identifying risks throughout the project, the mitigation of said risks and the ways in which they can be solved. There are three different types of risks, <b>Project Risks</b>, <b>Business Risks</b>, and <b>External Risks</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Project Risks</b>: Project risks are risks that are associated with the direct completion of the project, like scope and issues that can arise with scope (scope creep), resource constraints and technological constraints.</li>
            <li><b>Business Risks</b>: Business risks are something that can impact the overall organization, which could be something like the surrounding economy, regulations throughout the business world, or political environment.</li>
            <li><b>External Risks</b>: External Risks are something that come up from external factors (obviously), which could be something like natural disasters (more common than you might think), or political events.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Scale Down</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li><b>Tailor Your Process</b>: The first step in the process of scaling down risk management is to tailor the process down to a size that better fits your project. This could be something like instead of using a more complex framework of risk management, use a more simplified version that fits the needs of a smaller project. This is possible due to the fact that, as a smaller project, you probably do not need the most complex, ground-breaking technology to sort out your risks and solve them. This can be something as simple as sorting risks into fewer categories, using a simpler solution, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Identify Stakeholders</b>: By identifying your stakeholders sooner on, you can find out the actual financial repercussions of risks a lot sooner (which is always better than later). Conducting regular meetings with stakeholders can best simplify this process, as you can speak to the stakeholders and discuss some of the risks that you have identified and talk to them about the priority of these risks. This is incredibly important, as stakeholders are essentially what are making your project possible, so if they are not happy or left out of the loop, it is possible that your project will lose funding, thus failing.</li>
            <li><b>Focus on the most important risks</b>: Obviously, some risks are going to be higher priority than others. An example could be a vital risk of a database breach compared to a risk with User Experience. User experience is incredibly important, but I think most would agree that keeping sensitive customer information secure is vastly more important than some small User Experience issues.</li>
            <li><b>Simplify Risk Assessments</b>: As previously discussed, some forms of risk assessment are very complex to the point of not being necessary for some smaller projects. This can streamline what would be a complicated process into a much smaller process which will both take less time and fit all the needs you and your project need.</li>
            <li><b>Mitigation Plans</b>: Mitigation plans are the plans that solve the risks you have identified during risk assessment. This step can be equally as complicated as risk assessment, which if you are working on a smaller project, it is also probably just as unnecessary. Mitigation plans can be sorted into a simpler version, like a roadmap of the higher priority risks that you need to address, to lastly the lowest priority risks that need to be solved throughout the project's development.</li>
            <li><b>Communication</b>: Communication, like everything in project management, is incredibly important for solving risks in the project. Some forms of communication can be very complex (with not much to gain over simpler forms), so for a smaller team something like a Discord server could suffice, whereas on a bigger project you might need a completely new software made specifically for your team. It is important to think about how your developers are going to be communication throughout the development of your project, because a lot of time can be saved if you opt for a more effective form of communication.</li>
            <li><b>Resource allocation</b>: Resource allocation is something that, if not monitored, can be a downfall of an entire project. Using a simple chart of resource allocation throughout the risk mitigation process can make resource management much easier and can especially save a lot of time and money in the long run.</li>
        </ul>
