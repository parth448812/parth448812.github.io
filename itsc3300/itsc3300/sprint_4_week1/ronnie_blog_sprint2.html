    <h2>The Benefits of Risk Management</h2>

            <li>In project management, there’s lots of obstacles that your project could encounter.  In order to counter these risks, it takes good decision making along with experience and foresight.  In this blog I’d like to go over some of the benefits of investing time in risk management for your project, and how you should go about it in order to build up your project’s resilience.</li>        
        </ul>
        <h3>What is a Project Risk?</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Before getting into risk management strategies, it’s important to define what a project risk is so that you can get a better understanding of what you will be facing in future scenarios.  A risk (as it relates to a project) is anything that could impede the progress of a project.  Whether it affects the finishing time of a project, the budget of a project, or the overall finished product’s quality, a risk ultimately causes the project to not meet the needs of the stakeholders.  I know it sounds basic, but it’s really the best way to describe what project risk is, and once you know what risk looks like, then it’ll become much easier to spot with these techniques.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Risk Matrix</h3>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>[2]: Risk Matrix</figcaption>
        </figure> 
        <ul class="order">
            <li>A good tool to use in order to assess risk is the risk matrix.  With the risk matrix, you can identify what risks there will be along with how severe they could impact the project.  From there, you can determine the highest to lowest priority risk mitigation in order to protect the project in the best possible way.  After brainstorming your list of risks (or having someone else do an evaluation), you calculate the risk impact of each risk.  This is done by taking how badly that risk will impact the project and multiplying it by how likely it is to occur.  This way you can properly assess risk where the fail state may otherwise obfuscate the respective fail rate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You can then plot the risks on the matrix, with the x and y axis being the likelihood of the risk and the severity of the risk (interchangeable).  This gives you a good visualization of your priorities when it comes to managing risk.  As shown by the equation, it is best to prioritize high severity likely risks over lower severity unlikely risks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk Response</h3>

            <figcaption>[3]: Contingency Plan</figcaption>
        </figure> 
        <ul class="order">
            <li>After identifying your risks, you can help mitigate them by creating a risk response plan, which helps either eliminate the risk or lower it’s effect on the project to a negligible degree.  For each risk (usually starting with the highest priority), you should create a set of actions for the project team to preemptively remove the risk from the project space (or at least mitigate it).  So for example, if your project relies on shipments of hardware, you may want to preemptively try to shrink down the project timeline in order to compensate for any possible shipping delays that could occur.  Thinking like this in project management may seem like a lot of hassle, but it’s an important step in being prepared.</li>
            <li>Understanding the warning signs of the various risks is also something that should be documented.  Anything that would suggest that the risk has occurred or possibly will occur in the future should be documented in order to assist in identifying what to look out for.  In the future, you can also use these documented risk “triggers” in order to carry out reassessment (in order to see if their severity changed since you last checked).  Without reassessing your risk triggers, you may be caught off guard since one could become more likely than your initial evaluation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Contingency Plans</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>While it’s good to assess risks and plan for them accordingly, it’s also important to have contingency plans in case these risks do occur.  These are best created for each large-scale risk that could occur.  Typical contingency plans will state who should be the one to respond to the risk occurring, and what the immediate response is.  This assigns responsibility to certain people, so it’s important to let them know what these risk contingencies are.</li>
            <li>Contingency plans should include a timeline of the response, and in a way is just like a project schedule in that it should have a critical path, with the final product being the resolution of the problem.  That’s not to say that the project will be able to recover from all risks, just that the contingency plan should resolve the issue, whether it be fixing the risk and getting the project back on track or cleanly closing the project with a detailed report of what went wrong.</li>
            <li>When reassessing risks, you should also reassess your contingency plans to ensure that they are up-to-date with the risk information and so that they remain fresh in the minds of those who have to carry them out.  This is also where a new contingency plan can be made if the old one no longer fits for the risk in question.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>While risk management is something that may seem like something only useful for times of crisis, it actually can help projects that never see risks happen.  Evaluating the risks of your project helps guide you along the project’s path.  If you evaluate risks you are actively keeping your head up, which is a very good thing to do even if those evaluated risks never come to fruition.  Simultaneously, it helps you prepare for even the worst if it has to come to light.</li>
