        <h3>What is "Scope Creep"?</h3>    
        <p>Scope creep is best defined as the way in which a project is built beyond its' original requirements. This can happen due to features being introduced that were beyond
            the original scope of the project but still being implemented. This can become an issue especially when it comes to going over budget, over the original timeline of the
            project, causing issues with customers, stakeholders and developers.
        </p>
        <h4>Causes of Scope Creep</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bad project management</li>
            <li>Customer demands and developers adhering to said demands</li>
            <li>Vague/poorly designed project requirements</li>
            <li>Poor communication between customers and management</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Scope creep is an issue for many different projects, especially smaller teams in a less professionalized environment. Creating a team with proper roles and project
                requirements is necessary to avoid scope creep in latter parts of development.
            </li>
            <li>Due to Agile's dynamic nature, changing requirements and introducing new features is commonplace and an expected part of development. Without proper documentation
                of changes and widening of project scope, scope creep can quickly drown developers in more work than they are expecting. This causes delays and causes irritation with
                customers and stakeholders. If these problems are not addressed, companies can lose support financially from those financing the project.

        <h3>How to Avoid Scope Creep</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Define project requirements clearly and rigidly. In order to make scope creep a more manageable problem, defining clear requirements that provide instruction as to
                what exactly needs to be implemented makes further scope creep almost impossible.
            </li>
            <li>Set benchmarks and milestones at which to measure progress. As project requirements help prevent creep, providing a timeline to perform benchmarks and measure progress
                will aid in making sure that progress in the project is coming along in a timely manner. If any discrepancies in the timeline of the project are found, it is easier to
                spot a potential scope creep earlier on.
            </li>
            <li>Create a contract for all developers to sign and agree to. This contract should typically involve some rules on how to progress in development/restrictions on what individuals
                can add to the project with authorization. This can prevent individual developers from creating their own functionalities within the project that could burden the whole team.
            </li>
            <li>Communicate with the team and customers/stakeholders on regular intervals. Communication between these parties can refresh everybody's ideas on the project and introduce
                conversations on new requirements that can be approved/vetoed. This creates a dynamic that allows everybody to give their take on what is important to the project, whether
                it be making the timeline on time or adding extra requirements and increasing the quality of the project.
            </li>
            <li>Keep an eye on project budget. Watching the budget of the project, meaning how much money is being spent on creating the project, can allow management to see if the project
                is taking longer/taking more work than was originally anticipated. This can bring to light scope creep and make it clear what scope creep really <i>costs</i>.
            </li>
            <li>Allow requirement changes, but only if said changes are within a manageable length. Sometimes, customers will ask for features which they may not know what implementing
                them would cost. When a customer asks for a new feature to be implemented, a quick refresher on what the original project requirements were can go a long way, and a simple
                explanation of what the requirement would entail is beneficial for the customer to understand what it is that they are asking for.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Management Tips</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>Require developers to regularly communicate with management either via presentations or submitted documentation. Sometimes, individual developers may get tunnel vision
                on specific features they are implementing and during the process, get sidetracked. This can lead to forgetting what the original requirement actually was and thus making
                the developer think that they need to add something that is not necessary to complete the project. If developers add a feature that was not originally in the requirements,
                this can cause unnecessary work for both him and other developers. Mandating communication allows developers to explain in words what they did and if they were sidetracked,
                other developers/management can explain why what they did was not part of requirements and reverse the damages.
            </li>
            <li>Provide regularly timed demos (some do biweekly or monthly) of the project to allow developers and customers to see the application in use. Though this may not be entirely
                plausible in the earlier parts of development, once the project is running and performing demos can allow everyone involved to see what the application actually does. This allows
                developers to see the application in a form other than lines of code, and allow them to see if something needs to be tweaked (i.e. UX, UI, etc.) or if something needs to be added
                to make the project function in a better way.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure everything involving the project is efficiently documented for future maintenance. Developers when developing the project and meeting requirements of the project should
                document the process including what certain parts of code do, why it was formatted in the manner it was, the architecture of the software, etc. This makes future maintenance of the
                project more time-efficient and cost-effective. Refactoring code can take a very long time, especially if there is poor/no documentation on the project. This can also help developers
                stay on track with the requirements and make sure they don't veer off track.
            </li>
            <li>Be open to scope changes, but make sure to refresh the entire team on any changes that are made. Sometimes with projects that take a long time to develop, software changes can occur
                and it is necessary to keep the project up to date. This can lead to requirement changes that the entire team needs to be aware of, and thus allowing scope changes can be necessary
                at times. Agile makes this process easier, but there is a big difference between allowing scope change and involuntary scope creep. It is important to differentiate between these two concepts.
