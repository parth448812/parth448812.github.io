        <h3><strong>What is a project scope</strong></h3>     
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Defining your project scope is a very important first step in project management. With a well defined project scope you will be able to make sure that all aspects of the project are in line with the objectives and manage your stakeholder expectations. Creating your project scope will be done in the project planning stage and you will have to figure out your projects goals, tasks, costs, deliverables, and deadlines and then document them. Your scope will help guide your project team throughout the project. It will help define who is in charge of what and outline procedures for how work will be approved. The scope can change over the duration of the project however this is more likely in large projects and if your scope has been effectively defined at the beginning then these changes should be easy to make and implement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Defining your project scope</strong></h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>When defining your project scope you will need to communicate with project stakeholders in order to get requirements such as budget, quality, timeline and objectives. When talking with the stakeholders about the requirements it is important to get the most accurate information possible as this will make it easier to deliver a project that meets all of their expectations. Keep in mind your project scope should be very detailed and should outline a set of rules to follow when making decisions almost like the bylaws of the project. It is also very important for stakeholders to review your project scope and make sure they are happy with the cost, timeline, deliverables and everything else.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Key Elements of a well defined project scope</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li><u>Project Objectives:</u> A well written project scope will clearly define all objectives and goals. It should answer questionsddddddservices, products, or any results the project hopes to produce</li>
            <li><u>Scope Description:</u> A detailed narrative should be provided that describes the project's boundaries. It should clearly state the work that will be done for the project and what is included in the scope and what is not.</li>
            <li><u>Acceptance Criteria:</u> This is an important part of the scope as it defines what is considered to be a successful completion of the project. This should be based on the criteria defined by the stakeholders.</li>
            <li><u>Constraints:</u> You should list any and all constraints that may affect the completion of the project. This can include budget, resources, time and or regulations. Defining and understanding these constraints is important as it helps the team understand and struggles they might have and the better you understand the more you can expect them and adapt to overcome struggles. Example: “this project has a set due date of April 21st 2024 and a budget of 50,000 dollars”.</li>
            <li><u>Stakeholder Involvement:</u> There should be a written list of clearly defined expectations and responsibilities of the stakeholders in the project. Understanding what should be expected from stakeholders should allow easier communication and understanding what they will be responsible for will allow for smoother project execution.</li>
