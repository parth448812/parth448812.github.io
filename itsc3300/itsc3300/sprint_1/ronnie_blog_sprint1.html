        <h3>Lessons Learned From the Field: Scope Management</h3>

            <li>Scope management is one of the most important aspects of project management that can be often overlooked.  Scope is what the goals of a project are, and in a sense, what the project team hopes to achieve with their work.  A project team may have somewhat of an idea of what their project will be at the start, but as time goes on the likelihood of scope creep grows, and the project team will have started on too many things to handle.  With this in mind, it’s important to cover real-world cases of scope creep happening and why the projects fell victim to it.</li>

        <h3>Denver Airport Automated Luggage</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>A few years back, during the construction of the new Denver Airport, developers had planned a futuristic luggage system that was to be almost fully automated.  Such a system would not need humans to fill the job of moving luggage from one place to another, and would likely speed up the process of transferring luggage between flights.  One of the city’s hires said that the project was simply not feasible given the requirements and the resources that were provided by the city.  In addition to these warnings, a similarly envisioned system was in effect in an airport in Germany.  However, the production time for that project was much longer than the one proposed in Denver, which motivated the German airport to warn Denver about its ambitions.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, the warnings given to the project management team did not deter them, and the result is what you would expect: underachievement.  When the new airport opened, the automated baggage system was isolated to a small section of the airport and was restricted to departing flights in that section only.  The project was deemed a failure and is a good example of what can go wrong with project scope.  The opinions from the Germany airport and other experts shows that a project team should take a step back and evaluate their project scope before the execution phase.  Another thing that the project team did wrong was leave out their key stakeholders until after many of the planning decisions were set in stone.  An important takeaway from this is to ensure that you are communicating with stakeholders during the planning phase in order to avoid failures like this.</li>

        <h3>Dyson's Electric Car: Scope Creep In Cost</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>In 2017, appliance company Dyson had an ambitious plan to build a fully-electric car.  The car would have an estimated range of 600 miles before needing to recharge, and was targeting 2020 as its launch year.  However, after management troubles and billions of dollars, Dyson had announced that the project was closed as a failure.  So what went wrong?</li>
            <li>Similar to the issue that brought down the Denver airport automation system, this one was related to project scope.  In specific, the project management team had underestimated how much something like this would cost, and it ultimately led them to spending way more than they had initially anticipated.  One of the key things Dyson’s project management team failed to realize was that because Dyson was going to manufacture the car parts themselves, it was going to cost them more to produce each car than those cars would give back.  Normally, car companies can take these losses because they profit from their non-electric and hybrid vehicles.</li>
            <li>What is the takeaway here?  It’s important to not only look at the time constraints and project feature constraints, but also to understand how much each part of the project will cost.  For the higher-ups in a company, this realistically is their most important concern, and if you start execution of a project that has poor cost projections, then it can be shut down really quickly by the company’s top officials.  In addition to the cost of the project itself, it’s important to analyze the market you are trying to appeal to.  If projections say that the project won’t be profitable, then it is highly unlikely to ever deliver.</li>

        <h3>No Man's Sky: Learning from Scope Mistakes</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>Leading up to August of 2016, people in the gaming community were hyping up this game called No Man’s Sky.  The game promised a near-endless universe to explore, where players could fly between the estimated 18 quintillion planets in the game.  Safe to say, leading up to the launch date there was a lot of hype riding on the developers, Hello Games.  However, when the release day came, almost everyone was disappointed.  While players could explore the near-endless sea of planets on a one-to-one scale, there were many features that were promised to them that were absent in the final release.  So what went wrong?</li>
            <li>Firstly to add some context Sean Murray, the lead at Hello Games, was very passionate about this project.  On top of that, as the project got more word out, more and more people got progressively more hyped up.  These two factors create a perfect storm for a subtype of scope creep, coined “feature creep”.  As the project was in development, Murray continued to promise more and more features to the public during interviews regarding the game.  The issue was that these new features quickly led to the scope of the game being vastly expanded beyond its initial size, and after already having delayed the game by a few months, Hello Games didn’t want to delay it any further.  The game launched in August to very poor reviews, almost all of them citing gameplay issues and bugs along with a lack of features promised leading up to the game’s release.</li>
            <li>However, where some project teams would walk away from the project in shame, Hello Games realized that they had a chance to turn things around.  Over the course of the next few years, the team focused on working on the game silently.  First came bug fixes in order to repair the structure of the game itself, then more updates came that finally brought features that were promised at launch.  This leads us to today, where the game’s reviews are much more positive, and the game continues to be updated with more new features.</li>
            <li>The key takeaway from this is that Hello Games fell victim to a harmful type of scope creep, but never strayed away from the project.  Instead they were able to give it more time and carefully fix their game that launched so horribly.  Obviously, this wasn’t how Sean Murray and his team wanted the game to go, but they stuck with it and ended up creating a solid product that taught them valuable lessons.  The importance of understanding how time factors into promised features cannot be understated.</li>
