        <h3>What is Earned Value Management?</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li><b>Earned Value Management (EVM)</b>: Earned value management is a project management tool that provides insights towards project costs and efficiency. This blog post will delve into the specifics of why it is so valuable to implement earned value management into your project management regiment. By the end of this article, you will be a master at using this method to keep your project on track and within budget!</li>
            <li>Earned value management is a all-encompassing project management technique that uses project scope, project schedule and project cost. By using these variables, it gives management a systematic approach to measuring project performance.</li>
            <h4>What can earned value management do to help me?</h4>
            <li><i>Are we on schedule?</i></li>
            <li><i>Are we going over budget?</i></li>
            <li><i>Are we extending the project scope beyond its' original baseline?</i></li>
            <h4>What do we need to implement Earned Value Management?</h4>
            <li>In order to implement Earned value management, we need to have a <i>project plan</i>. This means before the project is began, management needs to establish what the project scope, budget and efficiency is going to be. Doing this can be done by speaking with customers and stakeholders as to what the requirements of the project is going to be ahead of time. By establishing all of these variables, management can more clearly see what the project is going to entail ahead of time to prevent going past the original project's scope and cost.</li>

        <h3>What are the specifics of using Earned Value Management?</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li><b>Planned Value</b>: Planned value is a variable that basically tells you where the project should be at any point in time in relation to budget and schedule. This is incredibly useful as this can point out if your project is taking too long or is costing too much money compared to how it should be progressing. This can be accomplished via some of the earlier techniques described, but I will recap:
                <li><b>Define Scope</b>: The definition of what the project is supposed to accomplish</li>
                <li><b>Assign Scope</b>: Break the scope down into multiple smaller parts that serve as achievable goals in the smaller scale</li>
                <li><b>Schedule Scope</b>: The time allotments for each part of the scope to keep project on schedule</li>
                <li><b>Budget Scope</b>: Assign a budget for the given scope of the project. This helps show how much money should be spent on each part of the project</li>
                <li><b>Baseline</b>: Define what the progress of the project should be based on. This can be something like functionality of the project or cost efficieny</li>
            </li>
            <li><b>Actual Cost</b>: Actual cost is basically the cost of completing the project. Actual Cost can be split into two types: Cumulative and current. Cumulative actual cost can be defined as the cost of the entire project, start to end. This can help define a budget for the project as it allows you to speculate at what the project is going to cost as a whole. Current actual cost is essentially the cost of the project at any given point in time. This can help define a cost for the project along the timeline of the project which can help show if the project is going over budget at any point during development.</li>
            <li><b>Earned Value</b>: Earned Value is a figure that establishes the value of the project. This can also be done in a cumulative or a current fashion. This allows management to see the progress of the project in a tangible manner, as in reality, money is what drives a project's creation. Cumulative earned value is defined as the estimated value of the project after completion. This serves as a baseline for the value of the project and what the customers will pay for the finished project. Current earned value is the value of the project at any point in development (much like the previous definitions)</li>
            <li><b>Cost Performance Index</b>: Cost performance index is a way of measuring the cost efficiency of the project as a whole. This is done via a ratio of the earned value and the actual cost. In simpler terms, cost performance index is earned value dividied by actual value. If a value of over 1 is the result, the cost performance index is in a good state. Otherwise, it is not a great result. In essence, if the cost performance index is greater than one, you are making money. One can use the cost performance index to see if their project is not being developed at an efficient manner or if your project is going over budget.</li>
            <li><b>Schedule Performance Index</b>: Schedule Performance Index is a "measure of schedule efficiency on a project". This is a way of seeing if your project is going over or under the schedule's baseline. This index uses a ratio much like cost performance index, except this time it is between earned value and planned value. The calculation is a ratio of the two, being done by dividing earned value by planned value. Much like cost performance index, if the value is greater than one, then the index is in a good state, indicating that you are on schedule and that the cost of the project is going along on a good manner. If it is less than 1, it means your project is doing the opposite, going over the schedule and losing money.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <p>Using <i>Earned Value Management</i> is nearly a necessary tool for any manager to hold in their aresenal. Implementing this strategy into your project management can help easier define some project variables and use them to the best ability as you can.
            Project management requires not only managing your developers and satisfying your customers, but also managing money. By using EVM you can much easier see the cost and value of your project, both on a <i>cumulative</i> and a <i>current</i> timeframe. Previous blogs have
            discussed making sure your project does not go over cost or schedule, yet there were not any techniques taught as to how to define these variables. Using earned value management, your will be equipped to assign a value to these variables and keep your project moving along well.</p>
