        <h3>Evolution of Project Communications Management</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li><b>Project Communications</b> has gone through a lot of change throughout the years. As you can imagine, communication used to rely mostly on just face-to-face as there was no other alternative, and this lasted up until the 20th century. During this time, telecommunications were invented and people slowly shifted towards using this method, especially when needing to converse over long distance. This reduced a lot of downtime between communications and improved workflow. Then in the late 20th century. the internet was created and thus emails became prominent in the world of communication, so pretty much every business also shifted to using emails (and telephones). This made instant communication possible, no matter the distance and also decreased the cost of communication. This also made communication paperless as everything was done over the internet. The internet also allowed collaboration on documents to allow more teamwork on documents without needing to be in the same place at the same time. During this same time, a lot of companies would also get software specifically designed for their company to allow them to manage communications throughout their company and development team. Even more advancements like video chat and AI chatbots have been created to further communication abilities even more and increase developer independence to reduce downtime.</li>
            <li><b>Collaborative platforms</b>: Collaborative platforms have become incredibly popular throughout the world. Today, collaboration platforms have emerged as the backbone of project communications management. Tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Asana have revolutionized how teams communicate, collaborate, and coordinate their efforts. These platforms offer features such as real-time messaging, file sharing, task assignment, and video conferencing.</li>
            <li><b>AI Assistant</b>: AI has become increasingly more potent in the past few years with Large Language Models taking off as of recent. Many companies use AI chatbots to allow developers to work more effectively by not having to ask coworkers about problems that could be solved via the chatbot. This keeps everybody working more independently and reduces downtime from communicating.</li>
            <li><b>Mobiles Applications</b>: Mobile applications/video chat programs have become incredibly popular since 2020 (the COVID pandemic). Applications like Skype, Zoom, Discord, etc. have been put into use for video chatroom for coworkers to be able to talk face to face from different locations and even share their screens to show what they are working on. These apps make face to face communication possible from any location on the world and this gives employees the freedom of working from home and completing the work at their own pace (as long as it is done on time). In the age of remote work and global project teams, mobile communication is paramount. Mobile apps and responsive design ensure that team members can access project information and communicate on the go. This flexibility has become crucial for modern project communications management.</li>
