        <h3>Watch Aspects and Present Industry</h3>        
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li><strong>Primary Aspects of Watches:</strong> Telling Time, Mechanics, Design</li>
            <li><strong>Watches are an Investment:</strong> Most people that purchase luxury watches nowadays do so as an investment, which they can resale 
                later for a greater price, making a profit. This causes the watches to be locked up collecting 
                dust, being of no use.</li>
            <li><strong>Why are Watches so Expensive?:</strong> Some people may wonder how prices of these watches could be so high that cause them to be seen
                 as investments, and the answer to that question is simply there are a handful of watchmakers 
                 left in the world. Because there is little supply of those watchmakers, and high demand of 
                 watches, the watchmakers demand a high salary.</li>
            <li><strong>Smartwatches are Taking Over:</strong> Nowawadays, most people that wear watches tend to wear smartwatches such as the 
                apple watch or a fitbit because of their technical functionalities and much cheaper prices,
                which has led to a decrease in interest for luxury watches or even their affordable alternatives, which have much more increased prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Purpose of Watches and Their Underlying Meaning</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li><strong>Purpose of Watches:</strong> While, people may assume that ordinary watches having 
                only one function, which is telling time they are completely wrong. In fact, most people 
                that are purchasing watches now do so for a special event or because they simply find a piece that looks magneficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Underlying Meaning of Watches:</strong> Many people that in fact do have ordinary watches 
            have gotten them passed down to them from family, which is something that means more to a person than any luxury watch could.</li>
        </ul>
