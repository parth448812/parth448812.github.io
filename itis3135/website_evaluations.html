        <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/">Worst Website</a></h3>
        <p class="cent"> This is a horrible website becasue it does not comply with any of the principles of CRAP. 
        
        <ul class="curver">
            <li><strong>C - Contrast: </strong>Reading the elements in the site is extremely difficult as the site has too many varying neon colors on a white background. This sharp contrast makes it
                very hard to focus on one single element.</li>
            <li><strong>R - Repetition: </strong>This site has over a 100 commercials with the same format mushed together, making it annoying and boring.</li>
            <li><strong>A - Alignment: </strong>Everything is out of alignment as the commericial sections are in no proper<br>space apart just randomly put on as the inside has text in no specific order.</li>
            <li><strong>P - Proximity: </strong>There are so many commericals on the page with little to no space in between<br>just split by a black border and some without.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/home.html">Good Website</a></h3>
        <p class="cent">On the contrary, this is a website that follows the principles of CRAP.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C - Contrast: </strong>Audemars Piguet store uses a simple black background with white text but<br>colorful images and videos. It even uses unique textured backgrounds when 
                showcasing their unique watches.</li>
            <li><strong>R - Repetition: </strong>The site does not repeat elements as each of the elements are represents a differnt watch and style. 
                This makes each watch represented in the best way possible.</li>
            <li><strong>A - Alignment: </strong>Audemars Pigquet uses a variety of sections that are each aligned wonderfully with an image. Each of these setions has the text large with unique fonts and captions.</li>
            <li><strong>P - Proximity: </strong>As you scroll down the site, you will see how the text is large, but adjacent to an well-placed image. 
                This format is repreated but the image and text is flipped by each section and watch, making the site engaging.</li>
