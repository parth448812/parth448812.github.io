            <li><b>Every Page has a layout using header, main, and footer: </b>Yes</li>
            <li><b>Home page is named index.html: </b>No, it is named project_1.html when it should just be index.html</li>
            <li><b>CSS and JS in Seperate Files: </b>Yes</li>
            <li><b>Consistent Layout Across All Pages:</b> Yes</li>
            <li><b>Appropriate content on home page including images:</b> Yes, I really like the way you incorporated forms, buttons, videos, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Link to all 5 Minimum Pages (including Home) and the Links Work on all the Pages:</b> Yes</li>
            <li><b>Navigation Bar is consistent position across pages:</b> Yes</li>
            <li><b>Appropriate Content on each page:</b> Yes, you have lots of great content mixed with various engaging features like forms.</li>
            <li><b>Website is Aesthetically Pleasing:</b> Yes</li>
            <li><b>Easy to navigate:</b> Yes, but it does have a bit of a delay when you click on each page, which might be due the the amount of content/data you have on each page.</li>
            <li><b>HTML or CSS Validation Links:</b> Yes, but the image you have for your html validator button is incorrect, it should be HTML 5 not 4.0.</li>
            <li><b>Contrast: </b> For the most part, contrast is good with varying shades of blue, but there is this one section in your home page where you put extremely dark blue on dark blue, with is not flattering to the eye. Other than that, everything is great regarding contrast.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment: </b>In your home page, you have an ordered list that is centered improperly, making the content look out of place as it is centered like everything with random numbers far left. Other than that, everything is great regarding contrast.</li>
